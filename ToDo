* Add more tests. In particular, attack the testing of RPC::XML::Server by
  using LWP and canned request data. When RPC::XML::Server has passed tests,
  it can then be used to test RPC::XML::Client.

* Create more examples. Of particular use would be examples of encapsulating
  an existing library with wrappers.

* Try to create tests for Apache::RPC::Server, perhaps using the
  Apache::AuthCookie approach to testing as a guide.

* Work towards getting the contents of methods/ to match the developing XML-RPC
  introspection standard.

* Work on getting all error messages and codes to conform to the developing
  XML-RPC consensus.

* Once a strong test suite exists, go back and make the code efficient (in
  lieu of clear)
